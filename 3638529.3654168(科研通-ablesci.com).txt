ABSTRACT
Fitness diversity is an idea in the field of evolutionary algorithms,
which calls for supporting the evolution of solutions at all fitness
levels simultaneously. In some cases, this idea may even extend to
cultivating the worst solutions. While this may seem counterintu-
itive, fitness diversity has shown its promise in algorithms such as
Hierarchical Fair Competition and Convection Selection. Although
these algorithms share many similarities, the role fitness diversity
serves in each of them is different. In Hierarchical Fair Competi-
tion, fitness diversity facilitates a constant incorporation of novel
genotypes into the solutions that are already good ‚Äì a mechanism
we dub First Glances ‚Äì and discovery of solutions through the ex-
ploration of neutral networks of different fitness levels ‚Äì which
we name Late Bloomers. On the other hand, Convection Selection
uses fitness diversity techniques to give broken solutions time and
shelter necessary to cross larger valleys in the fitness landscape ‚Äì a
mechanism we call Second Chances. In this work, we compare these
two algorithms and their respective mechanisms over a range of
numerical and 3D structure design optimization problems. We ana-
lyze the extent to which their mechanisms are utilized, and measure
the impact of these mechanisms on finding good solutions.

1 INTRODUCTION
One thing can be used in several ways. For example, since mastering
fire, people have used it to prepare food, provide light, heat oneself
up or destroy something. We use fire not just for the sake of it,
but as a tool that enables us to do other things. Similarly, in the
world of evolutionary computation, one of such tools is the idea of
fitness diversity. And just like fire, it should not be seen as a goal in
itself, but rather as something that facilitates the inclusion of other
beneficial mechanisms in the process of optimization.
Fitness diversity challenges the idea of focusing only on the good
solutions. Instead, fitness diversity methods provide solutions with
a chance to evolve and improve over time, no matter their quality.
Perhaps the earliest representatives of fitness diversity are Fitness
Uniform Selection Scheme (FUSS) [ 5,6] and Fitness Uniform Dele-
tion Scheme (FUDS) [ 6,11]. In these algorithms, evolution focuses
on either reproducing the solutions from the underrepresented fit-
ness ranges (FUSS), or removing solutions from the overrepresented
fitness ranges (FUDS). Another work which leads to greater diver-
sity in the quality of solutions is Age-Layered Population Structure
(ALPS) [ 2]. ALPS divides the population into layers based on their
age, continuously filling the youngest subpopulation with new ran-
dom solutions. Since the fitness of solutions is expected to increase
over time, this method does also indirectly support simultaneous
evolution on many fitness levels.
In this paper we want to focus on two other algorithms. First
of them is Hierarchical Fair Competition (HFC) [ 3,4]. HFC works
similarly to ALPS, however the population is not divided based on
the age of solutions, but on their fitness. Migration of solutions is
allowed only in one direction: from worse to better subpopulations.
This allows for continuous integration of novel genetic material
into solutions that are already good ‚Äì a mechanism we decided to
callFirst Glances. Alternatively, even if the fresh genetic material
does not manage to aid the optimization, the subpar solutions are
free to indefinitely float along the neutral networks [ 13] of varied
fitness levels in the fitness landscape, as they are shielded from the
selective pressure which would otherwise be exerted on them by
better solutions. This may allow them to find better local optima,

even after the best solutions have become stuck in a subpar local
optimum ‚Äì therefore, they become Late Bloomers.
The other algorithm covered in this paper is Convection Selec-
tion (ConvSel) [ 7,9]. Although Convection Selection divides the
population into subpopulations based on the fitness of the solutions
in a fashion similar to HFC, it allows for the migration of broken
solutions from good to bad subpopulations. This way, it facilitates
fixing of these broken solutions and crossing larger valleys in the
fitness landscape ‚Äì a mechanism we call Second Chances.
Although HFC and ConvSel use the mechanisms of First Glances,
Second Chances and Late Bloomers to evolve solutions over many
generations, it does not necessarily mean that these mechanisms ac-
tually contribute towards finding the best solutions. If a mechanism
does not contribute towards finding good solutions ‚Äì it may be
beneficial to remove it, especially if maintaining it adds some over-
head to the computations. Therefore, it is important to identify all
the mechanisms present in the algorithm and measure their impact
on the performance of the optimization process. Understanding
them better may lead to creating new, more efficient algorithms
that are composed of mechanisms that are proven to be beneficial
for a given problem, or streamlining already existing algorithms by
removing the mechanisms that prove to be unnecessary.
GECCO 2023 witnessed the debut of ‚ÄúAnalysing algorithmic
behaviour of optimisation heuristics‚Äù workshop. The workshop was
met with a positive reception and with an anticipation of further
research analyzing the inner workings of optimization heuristics [ 1].
In the spirit of the workshop, in this paper we set our eyes on
the algorithmic behavior of HFC and ConvSel in order to find
a confirmation ‚Äì or a rebuttal ‚Äì of the specific fitness diversity
mechanisms playing a role in the process of finding good solutions.
It is possible to measure a degree to which some mechanism is
utilized in the process of evolution. To do this, one must analyze
the evolutionary history of the best solution found during evolution.
In this paper we introduce three mechanism-centric measures. We
contrast their values with the quality of solutions found by HFC and
ConvSel for a set of numerical benchmarks from CEC‚Äô17 and a set
of evolutionary design tasks in order to determine the importance
of the considered mechanisms and their actual effect on the quality
of solutions found in evolution.
The structure of the paper is as follows. In Sect. 2 we describe
the Hierarchical Fair Competition and Convection Selection in
more detail. In Sect. 3 we discuss three mechanisms behind fitness
diversity: First Glances, Second Chances and Late Bloomers. We also
present the vector measures used later in order to assess the degree
to which these mechanisms are actually utilized by the algorithms.
In Sect. 4 we present the experimental setup. Sect. 5 shows the
results of the experiments and the analysis of the role First Glances,
Second Chances and Late Bloomers play in the process of finding
good solutions. Finally, Sect. 6 contains a short discussion of the
findings of this paper, and our plans for future research.
2 ALGORITHMS
2.1 Hierarchical Fair Competition
Hierarchical Fair Competition (HFC) [ 3,4] is a multi-population
evolutionary algorithm which utilizes a hierarchical structure ofthe population, with ùëÄsubpopulations (each containing ùëÜsolu-
tions) being assigned mutually exclusive fitness ranges. The fitness
value constituting the border between two subpopulations can be
seen as the ‚Äúexport threshold‚Äù of the worse subpopulation and
‚Äì simultaneously ‚Äì the ‚Äúadmission threshold‚Äù of the better one.
The worst subpopulation has no admission threshold, and the best
subpopulation has no export threshold.
Each subpopulation, with the exception of the worst one, has a
buffer of candidate solutions associated with it. The subpopulations
evolve independently of each other between migrations, which
happen once every ùëÄ¬∑ùëÜ¬∑ùëÖevaluations, where ùëÖis a scaling pa-
rameter controlling the frequency of migrations. During migration,
solutions are moved from the admission buffers to their respec-
tive subpopulations. In the implementation used in this paper, at
mostùëÜ
2best solutions are moved from the admission buffer to
their respective subpopulation, filling empty slots and replacing the
worst solutions in that subpopulation. The empty slots in the worst
subpopulation are filled with new, randomly generated solutions.
Admission buffers are emptied after each migration.
Solutions are moved from subpopulations to the admission buffers
only if their fitness exceeds the export threshold of their current
subpopulation. Then, such a solution is moved to the admission
buffer with the highest admission threshold lower than the fitness
of that solution (assuming maximization). In this paper, the syn-
chronous version of HFC is used, where solutions are moved to the
admission buffers only right before a migration.
In the original specification of HFC, the fitness ranges associ-
ated with subpopulations have to be assigned a priori. In this work,
Adaptive Setting of Admission Thresholds (HFC-ADM) is used
instead [ 3]. In HFC-ADM, the export threshold of the worst sub-
population is fixed, and based on the average fitness of randomly
generated solutions (as measured in the calibration phase, before
the proper evolution starts). All the other thresholds are recalcu-
lated before each migration. In the canonical version of HFC-ADM,
the admission threshold of the best subpopulation is calculated as
ùëìùëöùëéùë•‚àíùúéùëì, whereùëìùëöùëéùë• is the highest fitness in the population, and
ùúéùëìis the standard deviation of fitness in the (full) population. All
the other admission and export thresholds are then interpolated
linearly between the export threshold of the worst subpopulation
and the admission threshold of the best subpopulation. This ensures
that each intermediate subpopulation covers the fitness range of
equal width. However, in this paper we set the width of the best
subpopulation to be the same as the width of all other subpopula-
tions (with the exception of the worst subpopulation) to reduce the
differences between the implementation of HFC and ConvSel, and
therefore allow for a more fair comparison of their mechanisms
(First Glances, Second Chances, and Late Bloomers).
2.2 Convection Selection
Just like HFC, Convection Selection (ConvSel) [ 7,9] is a multi-
population evolutionary algorithm which utilizes a hierarchical
structure of the population, with ùëÄsubpopulations (each contain-
ingùëÜsolutions) being assigned mutually exclusive fitness ranges.
ConvSel is different from HFC in the following:
(1)In the ‚Äúequal width‚Äù variant of ConvSel used in this paper,
the width of all fitness ranges is equal, with subpopulations
806Late Bloomers, First Glances, Second Chances: Exploration of the Mechanisms Behind Fitness Diversity GECCO ‚Äô24, July 14‚Äì18, 2024, Melbourne, VIC, Australia
covering the entire range of fitness values present in the
population right before the migration.
(2) There are no admission buffers.
(3)Solutions migrate both upwards and downwards according
to their fitness.
(4)Right before a migration, fitness ranges of the subpopula-
tions are recalculated, and during a migration, solutions are
transferred to their appropriate subpopulations.
(5)There is no source of entirely new, randomly generated so-
lutions once the subpopulations have been initialized.
3 THE MECHANISMS BEHIND FITNESS
DIVERSITY
3.1 Measuring the ‚ÄúFirst Glances‚Äù mechanism
First Glances is a mechanism unique to HFC. Its name refers to the
ability of HFC to continuously introduce new, randomly generated
solutions over the entire evolutionary run, and to incorporate their
genetic material into older solutions. To see if this mechanism
aids the optimization, we need to verify if the ancestry of the best
solution contains solutions introduced later in the evolution, or if
it consists mainly of the solutions present in the initial population.
To that end we assign a vector named ùëéùëõùëêùëíùë†ùë°ùëúùëü _ùëèùëñùëüùë°‚Ñéùë°ùëñùëöùëí to
every solution in the population. The length of the vector matches
the number of epochs in the evolutionary run (with the ùëõ-th element
of the vector corresponding to the ùëõ-th epoch, where an epoch is
understood as the time between two migration events). Whenever
a new solution is created randomly (be it at the start of evolution
or sometime later), we assign it a vector of all 0s, except for the
element with an index corresponding to the number of the current
epoch, which is assigned the value of 1. When a new solution is
created by mutation, it inherits the value of ùëéùëõùëêùëíùë†ùë°ùëúùëü _ùëèùëñùëüùë°‚Ñéùë°ùëñùëöùëí
from its parent. When a new solution is created by crossover, the
values of elements of its ùëéùëõùëêùëíùë†ùë°ùëúùëü _ùëèùëñùëüùë°‚Ñéùë°ùëñùëöùëí are set to the average
of the values of the corresponding elements of its parents‚Äô vectors.
3.2 Measuring the ‚ÄúSecond Chances‚Äù
mechanism
3.2.1 Distribution of ancestors in the subpopulations. ConvSel lacks
the mechanism of First Glances, as it does not introduce new, com-
pletely random solutions to the population during evolution. In-
stead, it relies on the mechanism of Second Chances. The name of
Second Chances refers to the ability of ConvSel to allow broken
solutions coming from good subpopulations to be maintained and
fixed over time in subpar subpopulations. This way, ConvSel al-
lows for crossing wide and deep valleys in the fitness landscape. To
measure the degree to which this mechanism is actually utilized
by ConvSel, we need to check the distribution of subpopulations
occupied by the ancestors of the best solution. For this purpose
we use a vector measure called ùëéùëõùëêùëíùë†ùë°ùëúùëü _ùë†ùëùùëúùëù . The length of this
vector matches the number of subpopulations in the population,
with the first element of the vector corresponding to the worst
subpopulation, and the last element ‚Äì to the best subpopulation.
At the very start of evolution, ùëéùëõùëêùëíùë†ùë°ùëúùëü _ùë†ùëùùëúùëù of each solution is a
vector with 0‚Äôs on all positions except for the first element which
is set to 1. Whenever a new solution is created by a mutation or acrossover, its value of ùëéùëõùëêùëíùë†ùë°ùëúùëü _ùë†ùëùùëúùëù is calculated similarly to that
ofùëéùëõùëêùëíùë†ùë°ùëúùëü _ùëèùëñùëüùë°‚Ñéùë°ùëñùëöùëí .
During each migration, values of ùëéùëõùëêùëíùë†ùë°ùëúùëü _ùë†ùëùùëúùëù are recalculated
for all solutions in the population according to the formula:
ùëéùëõùëêùëíùë†ùë°ùëúùëü _ùë†ùëùùëúùëù =(ùëê_ùëíùëùùëúùëê‚Ñé‚àí1)¬∑ùëéùëõùëêùëíùë†ùë°ùëúùëü _ùë†ùëùùëúùëù+ùëùùëüùëíùë£_ùë†ùëùùëúùëù _ùë£ùëíùëê
ùëê_ùëíùëùùëúùëê‚Ñé,
whereùëê_ùëíùëùùëúùëê‚Ñé is the number of migrations performed so far, and
ùëùùëüùëíùë£_ùë†ùëùùëúùëù _ùë£ùëíùëêis a vector of 0‚Äôs with 1 in the position representing
the subpopulation occupied by the solution before the migration.
This way, the elements of ùëéùëõùëêùëíùë†ùë°ùëúùëü _ùë†ùëùùëúùëù should reflect the fraction
of the cumulative evolutionary time the ancestors of a solution
spent in specific subpopulations over the entire evolutionary pro-
cess.
3.2.2 Vertical mobility of the ancestors. Althoughùëéùëõùëêùëíùë†ùë°ùëúùëü _ùë†ùëùùëúùëù
can tell us if the ancestors of the best solution spent a lot of time
in low-quality subpopulations, it cannot reliably detect if they reg-
ularly visited low-quality populations for a short time. To cover
this possible scenario of utilizing the Second Chances mechanism,
we define an additional vector measure ‚Äì ùëéùëõùëêùëíùë†ùë°ùëúùëü _ùëöùëúùëèùëñùëôùëñùë°ùë¶ . The
length of this vector is equal to ùëõùë¢ùëöùëèùëíùëü _ùëúùëì_ùëùùëúùëùùë¢ùëôùëéùë°ùëñùëúùëõùë†¬∑2+1.
Each element of the vector corresponds to a specific size and direc-
tion of jumps between the subpopulations taken by the ancestors
of a solution during migrations. The first element of the vector
corresponds to the migration from the best subpopulation to the
worst one, the middle element corresponds to a jump of size 0
(i.e., a solution not changing its subpopulation during migration),
and the last element ‚Äì a jump from the worst subpopulation to
the best one. Initially, ùëéùëõùëêùëíùë†ùë°ùëúùëü _ùëöùëúùëèùëñùëôùëñùë°ùë¶ is set to all 0‚Äôs except
for the position corresponding to no movement, which is set to 1.
Whenever a new solution is created by a mutation or a crossover,
its value of ùëéùëõùëêùëíùë†ùë°ùëúùëü _ùëöùëúùëèùëñùëôùëñùë°ùë¶ is calculated similarly to that of
ùëéùëõùëêùëíùë†ùë°ùëúùëü _ùëèùëñùëüùë°‚Ñéùë°ùëñùëöùëí andùëéùëõùëêùëíùë†ùë°ùëúùëü _ùë†ùëùùëúùëù .
During each migration, values of ùëéùëõùëêùëíùë†ùë°ùëúùëü _ùëöùëúùëèùëñùëôùëñùë°ùë¶ are recalcu-
lated for all solutions in the population according to the formula:
ùëéùëõùëêùëíùë†ùë°ùëúùëü _ùëöùëúùëèùëñùëôùëñùë°ùë¶ =
(ùëê_ùëíùëùùëúùëê‚Ñé‚àí1)¬∑ùëéùëõùëêùëíùë†ùë°ùëúùëü _ùëöùëúùëèùëñùëôùëñùë°ùë¶+ùëóùë¢ùëöùëù _ùë£ùëíùëê
ùëê_ùëíùëùùëúùëê‚Ñé,
whereùëê_ùëíùëùùëúùëê‚Ñé is the number of migrations performed so far, and
ùëóùë¢ùëöùëù _ùë£ùëíùëêis a vector of 0‚Äôs with 1 in the position representing the
size and direction of a jump between the subpopulations made by
this solution during the current migration.
3.3 Measuring the ‚ÄúLate Bloomers‚Äù mechanism
ùê¥ùëõùëêùëíùë†ùë°ùëúùëü _ùë†ùëùùëúùëù can also be calculated for HFC, although in the con-
text of this algorithm its interpretation becomes slightly different.
Since HFC does not allow for Second Chances, ancestors occupying
subpar subpopulations cannot be linked to fixing broken solutions.
Instead, this measure allows one to observe the presence of ‚ÄúLate
Bloomers‚Äù, i.e., solutions that existed and drifted for a long time at
lower fitness levels, perhaps finding novel promising areas of the
fitness landscape.
We do not expect Late Bloomers to be present in ConvSel, as the
downward migration will inevitably introduce fragments of good
solutions to low-quality subpopulations, changing their role in the
807GECCO ‚Äô24, July 14‚Äì18, 2024, Melbourne, VIC, Australia Sofya Aksenyuk, Szymon Bujowski, Maciej Komosinski, and Konrad Miazga
search process. Similarly, the presence of ‚ÄúFirst Glances‚Äù might
introduce novel genetic material to low-quality subpopulations, so
we can only confidently confirm the presence of Late Bloomers in
the absence of First Glances.
4 METHODS
4.1 Mathematical benchmarks
Test functions used in this work are based on CEC 2017 Special
Session and Competition on Single Objective Real-Parameter Nu-
merical Optimization [ 14]. All test functions are minimized and the
search range is[‚àí100,100]ùê∑, whereùê∑is the dimensionality of the
problem. In this work, we use ùê∑=30. The experiments use the
Python implementation of the functions [ 12]. For the experiments
we selected the following 19 functions: ùêπ1,ùêπ3-ùêπ10, andùêπ21-ùêπ30,
as defined in [12].
4.2 Evolutionary design benchmarks
In addition to numerical benchmarks, in this investigation we in-
clude two optimization problems of a different nature. They concern
evolutionary design, i.e., evolving 3D structures or agents. In these
problems, the search space is discrete-continuous, and due to a
complex genotype-to-phenotype mapping, the fitness landscape
is highly rugged and chaotic. For these optimization problems we
use Framsticks simulation environment [ 8,10] and an open-source
Python interface that allows running customized evolutionary al-
gorithms.
Framsticks simulates and evolves three-dimensional designs con-
trolled by recurrent neural networks and is available as a native
application for all major operating systems. In the experiments, a
simple MechaStick physics engine is used to simulate elastic ‚Äústicks‚Äù
‚Äì bodies are composed of points with a mass that are connected with
joints. Control systems of simulated agents are composed of artifi-
cial neurons of various types, including sensors and effectors, that
can be freely connected ‚Äì with recurrent and parallel connections
allowed. In the experiments reported here, the following neuron
types are used: a sigmoid neuron, a neuron that always outputs
a constant value of 1, two kinds of effectors (rotation around two
axes), and two kinds of sensors (tilt and touch).
A body and a control system are described by a genotype that
can undergo mutation, crossover, and repair. There are many ge-
netic encodings in Framsticks, each with its own dedicated genetic
operators. The genetic encoding used here is the default one, de-
noted as f1. This is a high-level encoding that directly maps each
gene into a single part of the body or control system. For example,
the ‚ÄúX‚Äù symbol creates a ‚Äústick‚Äù in the body, parentheses ‚Äú(‚Äù and
‚Äú)‚Äù make a branching in the body so that tree-like structures can
be represented, and commas ‚Äú,‚Äù separate individual branches. Ad-
ditional symbols (genes) influence the length of sticks, the plane
of branching, or physical properties like the coefficient of friction.
Neurons are encoded in square brackets, with individual connec-
tions separated by commas. Each connection is described by the
relative index of the input neuron and the value of the connection
weight. Mutation operators modify specific aspects of the genotype
‚Äì for example adding or removing an ‚ÄúX‚Äù, adding or removing a
branching ‚Äú(.. . )‚Äù, adding or removing a neural connection, chang-
ing connection weight, etc. The crossover operator exchanges tworandomly selected substrings in parent genotypes. The simplest
genotype in f1isX(a single ‚Äústick‚Äù). More complex examples are X
X(X,X(X,X,‚Äû)) andX[N,1:0.3](X,X[N,‚àí1:0.2,1:0.4][N,‚àí2:0.8]).
The two optimization functions included in this investigation
are vertical position of the center of mass of a passive structure
(neural network is disabled) and velocity on land (neural network is
coevolved along with the body). The functions are further denoted
as ‚Äúvertpos‚Äù and ‚Äúvelocity‚Äù, respectively, and both functions are
maximized.
4.3 Experimental setup
The goal of the experiments is not to find the best performing pa-
rameters for the considered algorithms, nor is it to directly compare
the quality of their results. The goal of the experiments is to analyze
the influence of the mechanisms used by HFC and ConvSel on the
fitness of the best solutions found during the evolutionary pro-
cess. For this reason, the parameter values used in the experiment
were selected as the parameters that have shown good performance
in the past, but they have not been tuned specifically for the test
functions used in this work. Due to the similarity of the general
structure of HFC and ConvSel, the same values of parameters were
used for both algorithms.
Solutions in the numerical experiments are represented by vec-
tors of floating point numbers. Mutation consists in adding a ran-
dom vector, with value at each position drawn at random from the
normal distribution N(0,0.2). If any element of the vector after
mutation exceeds the allowed range, this value is reflected back
towards the allowed range. Crossover is performed as a weighted
average of two parent vectors with weights ùëüand 1‚àíùëü, whereùëüis
drawn on each mutation from the uniform distribution U(0,1).
Both HFC and ConvSel use a generational EA within their sub-
populations, with each new subpopulation consisting of 80%mu-
tated solutions, and the remaining 20%are crossed-over solutions.
The initial population for both algorithms is filled with ran-
domly generated solutions. Generation of random solutions for
both the initial population and the First Glances mechanism is done
in the same way. For numerical benchmarks, a random solution
is a random vector drawn from the uniform distribution over the
allowed range in each dimension. For evolutionary design problems,
a random solution is created by sequentially mutating the simplest
structure until it becomes complex enough (the number of body
parts is between 2 and 15, and the number of neurons is between 1
and 15).
The parameters of the algorithms used in the experiments are as
follows:ùëöùëñùëîùëüùëéùë°ùëñùëúùëõ _ùëñùëõùë°ùëíùëüùë£ùëéùëô =10,ùëõùë¢ùëöùëèùëíùëü _ùëúùëì_ùëùùëúùëùùë¢ùëôùëéùë°ùëñùëúùëõùë† =25,

5 RESULTS
5.1 Evaluating the ‚ÄúFirst Glances‚Äù mechanism
To evaluate the degree of utilization of First Glances mechanism in
HFC, we analyze the values of ùëéùëõùëêùëíùë†ùë°ùëúùëü _ùëèùëñùëüùë°‚Ñéùë°ùëñùëöùëí vectors taken
from the best solutions found during evolution, averaged over mul-
tiple runs. The averaged values of the ùëéùëõùëêùëíùë†ùë°ùëúùëü _ùëèùëñùëüùë°‚Ñéùë°ùëñùëöùëí , as cal-
culated for different optimization problems, are shown in Fig. 1.
The heatmaps clearly show that the vast majority of the genetic
material which ends up in the final, best solution, originates from
the initial population. It does not invalidate the mechanism of First
Glances, as the subsequent epochs will naturally introduce a far
lower number of new random solutions than was created initially.
The second epoch is also the source of a decent amount of genetic
material, however for most problems, the role of First Glances
in the following epochs is diminished. Despite that, new random
solutions still manage to sometimes influence the final solution.
This effect is, however, much more pronounced in the case of a lower
selective pressure ( ùë°_ùë†ùëñùëßùëí=2, Fig. 1a) than higher selective pressure
(ùë°_ùë†ùëñùëßùëí=5, Fig. 1b), where for most cases the novel solutions
introduced in the later epochs almost never influence the final
solution.
Among the tested benchmarks, the behavior of a few stands
out. Numerical functions ùêπ3andùêπ10utilize the mechanism of FirstGlances far more than the other functions. Function ùêπ3(Shifted and
Rotated Zakharov Function) uses progressively more First Glances
as the evolution progresses, which can be explained by the fact
that this function is fairly flat in the middle of the search range,
with just one local optimum, so additional First Glances are likely
to introduce useful solutions, as the basin of the global optimum
is very wide and the convergence to the global optimum might
be slow. On the other hand, function ùêπ10(Shifted and Rotated
Schwefel‚Äôs Function) uses First Glances less as the evolutionary
time progresses, as it is full of deep local optima, so while initially
First Glances may aid in finding basins of better local optima, once
the population starts to converge to a specific local optimum, it
becomes harder to find better solutions.
Evolutionary design benchmarks (with the exception of velocity
forùë°_ùë†ùëñùëßùëí=5) appear to utilize First Glances more than most of
the mathematical benchmarks.
Overall, while the mechanism of First Glances is used by HFC,
for most problems its importance quickly decreases after the first
epochs. Similarly, its importance appears lower when the selective
pressure is higher ‚Äì possibly because this makes it harder for new
solutions to compete against other solutions, which are already at
least partially optimized.
5.2 Evaluating the ‚ÄúSecond Chances‚Äù
mechanism
5.2.1 Distribution of ancestors in the subpopulations. The heatmap
forùëéùëõùëêùëíùë†ùë°ùëúùëü _ùë†ùëùùëúùëù , created in a similar fashion as the one
forùëéùëõùëêùëíùë†ùë°ùëúùëü _ùëèùëñùëüùë°‚Ñéùë°ùëñùëöùëí , is shown in Fig. 2.
For most mathematical benchmarks, the ancestors of the best
solution tend to occupy the best and the worst subpopulations,
mostly avoiding the subpopulations of a middling quality. This
could suggest that ConvSel actually gives broken solutions Sec-
ond Chances, although the low utilization of the subpopulation
of middling quality suggests that fixing the broken solutions in
these problems does not require incremental improvements, but
rather just one or two lucky mutations. Again, the behavior of a few
mathematical benchmarks stands out. For ùêπ3andùêπ10, all subpopu-
lations are utilized to a similar degree. For ùêπ21,ùêπ29, andùêπ30, all of
which are functions composed of several other, simpler functions,
the worst subpopulations are utilized the most, with ancestors of
the best solutions found in ùêπ30spending almost no time in the best
subpopulation.
The behavior of ConvSel is visibly different for the tasks of evo-
lutionary design. For both of the tasks there is a general tendency
of better subpopulations being utilized more, with the worst sub-
popualtions being heavily underutilized. It may suggest that in the
tasks of evolutionary design, the fitness of broken solutions is closer
to that of a parent solutions, unlike the mathematical benchmarks
where mutation can often change the quality of a solution to a very
high degree. It may also be related to the fact that for these tasks
the population did not manage to converge before the end of the
run, so the data we see captures the phase in which it is still easy
to improve the best solutions.
For both mathematical and evolutionary design benchmarks,
increased selective pressure (Fig. 2b) causes the middling subpopu-
lations to be utilized more.

5.2.2 Vertical mobility of the ancestors. The averaged values of
ùëéùëõùëêùëíùë†ùë°ùëúùëü _ùëöùëúùëèùëñùëôùëñùë°ùë¶ vectors are shown in Fig. 3. There is a clear
inverse relationship between the size of a jump between subpopu-
lations and the frequency of its occurrence, with the ancestors of
the best solutions not changing their subpopulations during most
migrations. While big improvements almost never happen, and
improvements are usually small and gradual, the degree to which a
solution might get broken is more varied, as indicated by steeper,
yet longer tails on the left side of Fig. 3.
Once more, mathematical benchmarks ùêπ3,ùêπ10,ùêπ21,ùêπ29andùêπ30
stand out. Their distribution of sizes of a jump between subpopu-
lations is fairly uniform, most likely indicating a very low range
of fitness values in the full population, or a very rugged fitness
landscape.
Although the tails of ùëéùëõùëêùëíùë†ùë°ùëúùëü _ùëöùëúùëèùëñùëôùëñùë°ùë¶ are long for the ùë£ùëíùëüùë°ùëùùëúùë†
benchmark, this function has the highest probability of the ances-
tors not changing the subpopulation during migrations, which may
again suggest that the population is still quickly improving within
the best subpopulation.
In the presence of a stronger selective pressure (Fig. 3b), the val-
ues ofùëéùëõùëêùëíùë†ùë°ùëúùëü _ùëöùëúùëèùëñùëôùëñùë°ùë¶ are more spread out, which may indicate
both a greater mobility of solutions and a smaller range of fitness
values in the full population, which pushes the fitness ranges of the
subpopulations closer together.

solutions found by the ConvSel algorithm, averaged from in-
dependent evolutionary runs. Optimization problems shown
in rows. The color scale is logarithmic.
Overall, the results confirm that the mechanism of Second Chances
is utilized by ConvSel. We have found a proof of both high and low
quality subpopulations being used by the ancestors of the best so-
lutions. We have also detected in the ancestry of the best solutions
a presence of solutions breaking and then being slowly fixed over
time.
5.3 Evaluating the ‚ÄúLate Bloomers‚Äù mechanism
Figure 4 presents the values of ùëéùëõùëêùëíùë†ùë°ùëúùëü _ùë†ùëùùëúùëù vectors of the best
solutions found by the HFC algorithm in different optimization
problems. Surprisingly, Fig. 4 reveals that most of the ancestors
come from low quality subpopulations, with very short time spent
by them in the best subpopulation. This might be explained by the
structure of a population in HFC, which allows solutions to move
upwards, but not downwards. The solutions reaching the best sub-
population become, therefore, trapped there, with the worst of them
being regularly replaced by solutions rising from the lower subpop-
ulations. In effect, solutions in a specific subpopulation can only
have ancestors from subpopulations not better than that subpopu-
lation, which eventually leads to the lower quality subpopulations
being overrepresented in the ancestry of solutions.
Increasing the selective pressure ( ùë°_ùë†ùëñùëßùëí=5, Fig. 4b) causes the
ancestors of the best solution to spend more time in high quality

subpopulations, making the distribution more even than it is for
a lower selective pressure ( ùë°_ùë†ùëñùëßùëí=2, Fig. 4a). Intriguingly, it
simultaneously appears to decrease the time the ancestors of the
best solution spent in the best subpopulation.
While in theory the best solutions could survive over longer
periods of evolutionary time in the best subpopulation, avoiding
the Late Bloomers mechanism, Fig. 4 clearly shows that this is
not the case. A possible exception to that rule can be observed
for theùë£ùëíùëüùë°ùëùùëúùë† benchmark, behavior of which might, however, be
explained by the population not being yet converged. Compared to
the mechanism of First Glances, the mechanism of Late Bloomers
seems to be more robust and utilized more during evolution.
5.4 The relationship between the utilization of
the mechanisms and the quality of the
solutions
To determine the degree to which different mechanisms were uti-
lized by evolution, we introduce several scalar measures based on
the vector measures described in Sect. 3. Measures using suffix ùëêùëúùëî
(shorthand for ‚Äúcenter of gravity‚Äù) are defined as a weighted sum
of indices of a vector, with the elements of the vector serving as
weights, divided by the length of the vector. Measures using suffix
ùë†ùë°ùëëare defined as the standard deviation of the values of the vector.We include the following measures in our analysis: ùëèùëñùëüùë°‚Ñéùë°ùëñùëöùëí _ùëêùëúùëî
(for HFC),ùëöùëúùëèùëñùëôùëñùë°ùë¶ _ùë†ùë°ùëë(for ConvSel), ùë†ùëùùëúùëù _ùëêùëúùëî, andùë†ùëùùëúùëù _ùë†ùë°ùëë(for
HFC and ConvSel).
We have analyzed the relationships between the utilization of
different mechanisms and the fitness of the best solutions for each
combination of the fitness function and the size of the tournament.
To express these relationships quantitatively, we calculated Spear-
man‚Äôs rank correlation coefficients. The decision to use Spearman‚Äôs
correlation was dictated by the observation that the distributions
of fitness values and the utilization of mechanisms are not always
normal ‚Äì in some cases, clusters and outliers were detected.
The values of the correlations are presented in Tables 1a and 1b.
Statistically significant correlations ( ùëù=0.05) are shown in bold.
The relationship between the value of a measure and the fitness
of a solution (to which we will refer as a ‚Äúutility‚Äù of a measure)
is problem-dependent, with some of the test functions benefiting
more from certain mechanisms than others.
First, we analyze the mechanisms of HFC: First Glances and Late
Bloomers. For mathematical benchmarks, there is a general ‚Äì yet
not unanimous ‚Äì preference of utilization of the mechanism of
First Glances, as indicated by positive correlations with fitness for
ùëèùëñùëüùë°‚Ñéùë°ùëñùëöùëí _ùëêùëúùëî. This suggests that the mechanism of First Glances
aids evolution. For mathematical benchmarks, it appears overall
beneficial for solutions to utilize all subpopulations to a similar
degree (as shown by the negative utility of ùë†ùëùùëúùëù _ùë†ùë°ùëë), avoiding
the overrepresentation of low-quality subpopulations, or even to
focus on the subpopulations of higher quality (as shown by the
positive utility of ùë†ùëùùëúùëù _ùëêùëúùëî). This suggests that the mechanism of
Late Bloomers may not always be beneficial, especially when the in-
flux of solutions from the low-quality subpopulations is too strong,
which may disrupt the exploration of neutral networks of higher
fitness. This negative aspect of Late Bloomers could potentially be
mitigated by adding a mechanism of genotypic diversity into the
subpopulations of HFC.
For the problems of evolutionary design, the utilities of First
Glances and Late Bloomers often do not match the trends seen for
the mathematical benchmarks. However, for these problems, none
of the correlations related to HFC were statistically significant.
When it comes to ConvSel, the utility of the mechanism of Sec-
ond Chances appears to be far more problem-dependent that it is
for First Glances and Late Bloomers. Statistically significant corre-
lations can be found in both directions. This suggests that while the
absolute value of the utilities is often quite high (for example for
ùêπ21orùêπ23) ‚Äì which means that the mechanism of Second Chances
plays a significant role in evolution ‚Äì the exact role it plays depends
on the problem itself.
The sign of utility for a mechanism changes the interpretation
of the correlation. Values close to zero indicate that the utilization
of the mechanism did not noticeably influence the search process.
Just because a mechanism is utilized more when the final fitness
is worse does not necessarily mean that the mechanism is detri-
mental. Instead it may suggest that when it is hard to discover
good solutions during evolution, evolution relies more than usually
on that mechanism in order to overcome the issue. The positive
correlation, on the other hand, should indicate that the mechanism
actively aided the search not by mitigating the losses, but rather by
amplifying the gains.

6 SUMMARY
In this paper we took a closer look at the mechanisms present in two
fitness diversity algorithms ‚Äì Hierarchical Fair Competition (HFC)
and Convection Selection (ConvSel). We identified three mecha-
nisms enabled by supporting simultaneous evolution on several
fitness levels: First Glances (continuous introduction of novel solu-
tions to the population), Second Chances (fixing broken solutions
which allows for crossing fitness valleys), and Late Bloomers (find-
ing novel promising areas in the fitness landscape by drifting along
some specific fitness level). We also developed measures which
allow one to estimate the level of utilization of these mechanisms.
The main contribution of this paper is an in-depth exploration
and analysis of different mechanisms behind fitness diversity. Al-
though the utilization of First Glances is relatively low ‚Äì the vast
majority of the genetic material which ends up in the final, best
solution, originates from the initial population ‚Äì this mechanism
seems to generally benefit the quality of solutions found by HFC.
On the other hand, Late Bloomers, while utilized more due to the
structure of the algorithm, may in some cases allow low-quality
subpopulations to impede the efforts of higher-quality subpopula-
tions. Although it is clear that the mechanism of Second Chancesplays an important role in the behavior of ConvSel, the exact way
it aids optimization depends strongly on the problem itself.
While the findings of our experiments are already useful, we ac-
knowledge the limited scope of the research presented in this paper.
The importance of different mechanisms will differ depending on
the parameter values of the algorithm, while in the experiments
discussed above most parameters were fixed ‚Äì both these com-
mon to all evolutionary algorithms, and these specific to HFC and
ConvSel. Additionally, more focus should be put on exploring how
the importance of different mechanisms changes depending on the
length of the evolutionary process. After the population converges,
the overall behavior of the algorithm changes as well, which should
be taken into consideration when examining the utility of different
mechanisms.
Despite these shortcomings ‚Äì which we intend to tackle in fur-
ther research ‚Äì we believe that this investigation constitutes an
important first step towards a better understanding not only ifthe
fitness diversity algorithms work well, but also how andwhen they
work. It shows the potential hidden in analyzing the relations be-
tween the optimization problems and the mechanisms employed
by the optimization algorithms.
In the future, we also want to compare the properties of optimiza-
tion problems [ 15] with the utility of different mechanisms, which
should help one discover dependencies that will guide researchers
towards developing new algorithms dedicated for problems with
specific characteristics.
